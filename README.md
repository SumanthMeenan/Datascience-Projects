1.)Music Genre Classification

There are 10 genres each containing 100 songs. We need to predict the genre based on the audio.

Extracted 26 features from audio files and built a artificial neural network which predicts the genre for a given audio file

2.) Histopathologic Cancer Detection

There are almost 2.2 lakh labelled images in which 60% images have cancer, 40% images have no cancer

Built a CNN Model 2 predict whether the image has cancer tissue or not

3.) U_NET Algorithm

We trained the unet with (128,128,3) rgb image as input and (128,128,1) mask as output

So, if we give rgb image, it needs to predict the mask image

Pixel level classification thats y 1*1 convolution at the end
